# Word Master

ðŸ”— https://octokatherine.github.io/word-master/

Heavily inspired by [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/), Word Master is a word guessing game similar to Mastermind. I created this because I love Wordle, but the once a day limit leaves me wanting more.

## Rules

You have 6 guesses to guess the correct word.
Each guess can be any valid word.

After submitting a guess, the letters will turn gray, green, or yellow.

- Green: The letter is correct, in the correct position.
- Yellow: The letter is correct, but in the wrong position.
- Gray: The letter is incorrect.
